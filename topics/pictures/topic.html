alt="\Golden-mantled ground squirrel"
src="data/Golden-mantled_ground_squirrel_-_14_percent.JPG" width="56%"
/></a></p>

<p>The page header and the Golden-Mantled Ground Squirrel picture fit on a 768
pixel high display with this line.</p>

<p><a href="data/Yellow-bellied_marmot.JPG"><img alt="Yellow-bellied marmot"
src="data/Yellow-bellied_marmot_-_19_percent.JPG" width="75%" /></a></p>

<p>The Yellow-Bellied Marmot picture fits on a 768 pixel high display with this
line.</p>

<p><a
href="data/Yellow-bellied_marmot_and_Golden-mantled_ground_squirrel.JPG"><img
alt="marmot and squirrel"
src="data/Yellow-bellied_marmot_and_Golden-mantled_ground_squirrel_-_23_percent.JPG"
width="90%" /></a></p>

<p>The picture of both animals fits on a 768 pixel high display but typically
this line does not fit with the picture.</p>

<p><strong>Display pictures as a percent of the working area's
width.</strong></p>

<p>Specify pictures as a percent width of the container's width. This has the
advantage of resizing the image so that it always fits horizontally in the
display on displays less than 1024 pixels wide. </p>

<p><strong>Initially display images at or near the actual display
resolution.</strong></p>

<p>Create and initially display a reduced resolution image if the original is
significantly higher resolution than the display resolution. The reduced
resolution image typically has a smaller file size for faster initial load.</p>

<p>This reduced resolution image has the advantage of being directly supported
by Insert Image in Amaya. Images with 3000 or more pixel width do not display
successfully in Amaya with container width significantly smaller. As an example
directly inserting the full resolution image
Yellow-bellied_marmot_and_Golden-mantled_ground_squirrel.JPG (3648 wide by 2736
high). It does not work in Amaya but it does work in modern browsers.</p>

<p><strong>Make the image a link to the full resolution image.</strong></p>

<p>Make the displayed image a link to the full resolution image. Typically
browsers open a new page just showing this image. Clicking on this image again
provides the full resolution image which requires scrolling around to see all
of it.</p>

<p><strong>Page width</strong></p>

<p>The page width used by the .css files is 960 pixels between the vertical
lines. There is an additional padding of 20 pixels on each side of the text and
pictures. This leaves 920 pixels as the 100% width for a picture. A 50% width
picture is 460 pixels wide. The squirrel picture at the top of the page is
displayed at 56% width which is 515 pixels in the 920 pixel working width.</p>
